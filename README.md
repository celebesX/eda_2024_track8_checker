# EDA Contest 2024 Anlogic Checker

1ï¼‰How to compile the program: 
   cd <path_of_the_src_code>
   make 

2) How to run the checker program:
   The program takes command from a run script file.
   A demo run script can be found in <path_of_the_src_code>/demo.run
   
3) Supported Command 
   3.1) read_arch <*.lib> <*.scl> <*.clk>
        Command to read FPGA device related files.
		.lib: instance models
		.scl: FPGA site information
		.clk: FPAG clock region information		
		
   3.2) report_arch
		Command to report FPGA device related statistics.
				
   3.3) read_design <*.nodes> <*.nets> <*.timing>
        Command to read benchmark related files.
		.nodes: design instances
		.nets: design nets

   3.4) report_design
   	    Command to report design related statistics.
		
   3.5) read_output	<*.nodes.out>
		Command to read output of optimized instance locations
		
   3.6) legal_check
		Command to perform legalization check, including:
	      a) at any location, if an instance type matches a site type
